/**
 * `GCompletion` provides support for automatic completion of a string
 * using any group of target strings. It is typically used for file
 * name completion as is common in many UNIX shells.
 *
 * A `GCompletion` is created using [func@GLib.Completion.new]. Target items are
 * added and removed with [method@GLib.Completion.add_items],
 * [method@GLib.Completion.remove_items] and
 * [method@GLib.Completion.clear_items]. A completion attempt is requested with
 * [method@GLib.Completion.complete] or [method@GLib.Completion.complete_utf8].
 * When no longer needed, the `GCompletion` is freed with
 * [method@GLib.Completion.free].
 *
 * Items in the completion can be simple strings (e.g. filenames), or
 * pointers to arbitrary data structures. If data structures are used
 * you must provide a [type@GLib.CompletionFunc] in [func@GLib.Completion.new],
 * which retrieves the itemâ€™s string from the data structure. You can change
 * the way in which strings are compared by setting a different
 * [type@GLib.CompletionStrncmpFunc] in [method@GLib.Completion.set_compare].
 *
 * `GCompletion` has been marked as deprecated, since this API is rarely
 * used and not very actively maintained.
 *
 * ## Skipped during bindings generation
 *
 * - parameter `new_prefix`: Unsupported string with cType gchar**
 * - field `func`: CompletionFunc
 * - field `strncmp_func`: CompletionStrncmpFunc
