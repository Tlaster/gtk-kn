GTK 4 is the latest version of a popular cross-platform widget toolkit written in C.
Thanks to GObject-Introspection, GTK's API can be easily targeted by various programming languages.

The `gtk-kn` project provides bindings to many GTK-related libraries, which we will be using throughout this user guide.

## Who this guide is for

This guide assumes that you are familiar with [Kotlin Native](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-overview.html). If this
is not the case, reading Kotlin's documentation is a great way to get started. If you have experience with another
high-level language such as Python or Swift, you might find that
reading [Kotlin's introductory documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/learning-materials-overview.html)
provides sufficient information as well.

Fortunately, this - together with the desire to develop graphical applications - is all that is necessary to benefit
from this guide.

## How to use this guide

In general, this guide assumes that you are reading it in sequence from front to back. However, if you are using it as a
reference for a certain topic, you might find it useful to just jump into it.

The guide strives to explain essential GTK concepts paired with practical examples. However, if a concept can be better
conveyed with a less practical example, we took this path most of the time. If you are interested in contained and
useful examples, we refer you to the corresponding section of `gtk-kn`'s repository.
