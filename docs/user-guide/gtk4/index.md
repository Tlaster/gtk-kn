# GTK4

[GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) (GIMP Toolkit) is a popular open-source toolkit for developing graphical user interfaces (
GUI) for software applications. It was originally developed for the GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) software but
has since become a general-purpose toolkit for creating user interfaces on the Linux, Unix, and Windows operating
systems. GTK is developed and maintained by the [GNOME project](https://www.gnome.org/), which is a popular desktop
environment for Linux-based operating systems.

GTK4 is the latest version of the toolkit, which was released in 2021. It includes several new features and improvements
over the previous version (GTK3). One of the significant changes in GTK4 is the use of the Vulkan graphics API for
rendering, which provides better performance and enables features like hardware acceleration and better support for
modern GPUs.

GTK4 also includes new APIs for creating user interfaces, including a new layout manager that provides more flexibility
in arranging widgets and new widgets such as GtkListView for displaying data in a list format. Additionally, GTK4
introduces a new event controller API that simplifies event handling and provides better support for touch and
gesture-based interactions.

Another major change in GTK4 is the removal of deprecated APIs and the adoption of modern coding practices such as using
CSS for styling and providing better support for accessibility. Additionally, GTK4 has improved support for
internationalization and supports more languages than before.

In summary, GTK4 is a comprehensive toolkit for creating user interfaces that provides access to system-level features
and includes a wide range of widgets for building desktop applications. Its new features and improvements make it a more
powerful and flexible toolkit for building modern, high-performance user interfaces on Linux, Unix, and Windows
operating systems.
