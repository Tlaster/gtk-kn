# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience
for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Positive behaviors that contribute to a welcoming community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Providing and accepting constructive feedback graciously
- Taking responsibility, apologizing, and learning from mistakes
- Prioritizing the well-being of the community over individual benefit

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- Sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Any behavior that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and will take fair and appropriate action
in response to any unacceptable behavior. Leaders have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code,
issues, and other contributions not aligned with this Code of Conduct and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions as appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and also applies when an individual is representing the community
in public spaces, such as using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
appointed representative at an event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to community leaders
at [here](https://gitlab.com/gtk-kn/gtk-kn/-/issues/new). Please mark the issue as "confidential" to ensure privacy.
Reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, and all leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and
security of the reporter.

Conduct:
