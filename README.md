gtk-kn provides Kotlin Native bindings for the GTK framework. GTK is a popular cross-platform GUI toolkit that provides
a complete set of widgets for building graphical applications. Kotlin Native is a technology that allows Kotlin code to
be compiled to native code for various platforms.

Please note that this project is a work in progress and is not yet ready for production use. We welcome contributions
from anyone who is interested in helping us improve the project.

## Building the project

TBD

## Running the examples

The `samples` directory contains sample applications that demonstrate how to use the GTK bindings in Kotlin Native. To
run the examples, please refer to the instructions in the [samples README](samples/README.md) file.

## Roadmap

Please refer to the [project board](https://gitlab.com/gtk-kn/gtk-kn/-/boards) for more information on our roadmap and
progress.

## Why the name gtk-kn?

The "kn" in gtk-kn stands for Kotlin Native. We chose this name because it is similar to other projects that provide
language bindings for GTK, such as gtk-rs for Rust.
